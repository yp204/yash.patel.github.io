<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>

<p>The three types of SEO that I found interesting are Off-page SEO, On-page SEO, and technical Seo. To elaborate On-page SEO, is basically where you optimize each element on the page to process the discovery of the major search engines. The main factors that go along the page. One of the important ones I found interesting is the meta tags. In this factor, having titles and description tags helps search engines identify the purpose of the page(Sheppard,2024). Another factor is External Linking. I think this is very important to have because it allows more awareness of your landing pages, where viewers can have access to information than just one. For example, having a page dedicated to Instagram will help increase more engagement and more awareness. That results in more traffic flow to your landing page. Lastly, having multimedia is important in SEO, as well as images, icons, videos, PDFs, etc. This helps with user engagement for your landing page. Aside from making your landing page visually appealing, having some sort of engagement for users makes the landing page more active and improves rankings.
</p>

<p>Next, Off-page SEO involves actions taken outside of your landing page to impact your search engine rankings and how users are influenced by your content. Some of the main techniques behind this SEO are for example Backlinking. This is a form of trick, it helps with search engine algorithms making sure that your website category is met. This can help increase search engine ranking and improve search visibility, resulting in more traffic coming to your landing page. Another technique is  Brand Authority. This is where it can bring organic traffic to your landing page. In some cases, search engines tend to give a better favourite on authorized brands, which can lead to a higher ranking on search engine pages. Lastly, Social Signal helps with your landing page rank using the power of social media and marketing. For example, the more shares and likes the page gets, the better the traffic and search engine.</p>

<p>Lastly, Technical SEO helps solidify a site's foundations and structure by making sure its readability functions (Sheppard,2024). It can help index your site ensuring that it's easy to navigate and there is not any issue in the landing page. One of the features is site speed, which can help load the website faster. Technical SEO can make it mobile-friendly and can improve search rankings to ensure its compatibility with mobile search engines. Lastly, schematics, making sure that proper coding is embedded with search engines to ensure the purpose of your landing page. For my information, I have incorpoated a Meta Tag. A meta tag is information that you can use to the search engine and the viewer about your landing page more about you page and information it has!.

<h2>Social Media Optimization</h2>

<p>Social Media Optimization is the process of improving the reach of users to your landing page through social media. This is an important task to help drive more traffic to your landing pages. The three techniques that I found very intriguing about this segment are the utilization of hashtags, engaging through live video sessions, and scheduling posts consistently. Firstly, the optimization of hashtags on social media platforms can increase engagement and exposure to your landing page. For example on Twitter, hashtags are used for searches, so only implementing a few hashtags in a post will help generate more engagement and traffic. For Instagram, having a collapse of hashtags is recommended, as this can increase the drastic flow of traffic incoming. Putting these forms of techniques will help grab the attention of users to come to view your landing page.</p>

<p>Another technique I found very useful is engaging through live video sessions. This is an interesting approach where interactive content can be posted such as polls, q and a session, and campaigns to get more traffic driven to a particular content. Not only this, this can also improve brand loyalty, thus resulting in more traffic to the actual website. With this technique, improvement can be made with all the feedback from users to make a better and more functional landing page. Through this technique, a potential increase in traffic to your landing page is certain in my opinion. Having the importance of understanding the needs and wants of the audience is important, and thus, this technique can help both sides of the world. I think this is very useful in terms of trying to build an audience as it can increase more activity and traffic about your cause or the purpose of the page.
</p>

<p>Lastly, another important technique to have incoming traffic is coming up with new posts and new content every week to help users to have engagement in the landing page. If the website does not do frequent updates, there will be no incoming traffic. Making sure that a consistent posting schedule can increase the likelihood of interaction. I think this can be a useful technique if you're creating a brand or trying to show some sort of awareness on your landing page. I think definitely if you are starting small, using this technique will help you at the starting position before you build your way up.
