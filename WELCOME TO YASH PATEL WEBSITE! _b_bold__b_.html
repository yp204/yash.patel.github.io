<h2>About Me/Education</h2>
<p>  Hello, my name is Yash Patel, and I'm in Business Technology Mangement in 3rd Year. Business technology management is a program 
    where you learn both <strong> business and IT world </strong>. In this program, we take courses like,<strong> Programming, Data Analytics, IT Infrastructure, Information systems, 
    and system analysis and design </strong>, more technology based heavey. One of the core business classes that is implemented in this program is a lot of  <strong>financial accounting, Finance, 
    and Economics classes </strong>. 

    <hr>

</p><h3>Courses</h3>
<p> One of the courses that I found very useful is  <strong>Data and Information Management </strong>. In this course, we learned about SQL and all about database. I found this 
    class very useful because it taught me about analyazing data, Creating Data, and filtering to find certain key things in the in the database. Having the 
    fundamentals of learning SQL is important not only for knowing it for your own benefits, but because, in job, filtering data and using the SQL commands will
    come in clutch when needed. Espically, when filtering and analyzing data in a job will be become day to day easier.
