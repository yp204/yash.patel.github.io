    <h1>Courses</h1>
    <div id="Courses">
      <p>One of the courses that I found very useful is <strong>Data and Information Management</strong>. In this course, we learned about SQL and all about databases. I found this class very useful because it taught me about analyzing data, creating data, and filtering to find certain key things in the database. Having the fundamentals of learning SQL is important not only for knowing it for your own benefits, but because, in a job, filtering data and using SQL commands will come in clutch when needed. Especially, when filtering and analyzing data in a job will become day-to-day easier.</p>
